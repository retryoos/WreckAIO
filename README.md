# ðŸ‘Ÿ WreckAIO - Sneaker Auto Checkout Bot 

*Story:*  

At the age of 16, my interest in Python sparked alongside my growing curiosity about Sneaker Reselling and the entire aftermarket scene. This was around 2020, a time when securing a pair of limited-edition sneakers could potentially yield significant profits due to the scarcity and incredible profit margins.



Given the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic, sneaker releases had shifted mainly to online ones, which intensified further the desire for software solutions that could assist one to effortlessly obtain the limited item that they were after. Despite my limited knowledge of software development at the time, I was captivated by the idea of crafting such complex software capable of reverse engineering security measures. The ability to seamlessly navigate through the checkout process and bypass robust defenses such as Akamai, PerimeterX, and Datadome, especially when safeguarded by industry giants like Nike or Adidas, fascinated me.



Recognizing the complexity of such a task, I decided to take a more measured approach, by starting off writing scripts for local shops in Greece that were expected to release potentially profitable sneakers. As my understanding of Python grew, I decided to rewrite the code, incorporating object-oriented programming, with the goal of creating a more user-friendly environment, enabling the user to manage tasks from an Excel (CSV) file, input data through a JSON file and utilize threads for simultaneously executing multiple tasks with different checkout profiles.



Reflecting on this journey, I take pride in what I achieved, even though the code may not be flawless, the experience significantly expanded my understanding of software development and implanted a deep appreciation for the entire process.
